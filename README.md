# Menu-Driven-CPP-Console-Programs
-Simple basic problem solving with C++ on menu driven programs using structural programming.

-Write a C++ program that takes 2 numbers forming a range then accordingly

-Your program should contain and display a selection menu as follows:

(1)- Get all Even numbers within the range

(2)- Get all odd numbers within the range

(3)- Get the sum of the numbers within the range

(4)- Get all prime numbers within the range

(5)- Get maximum prime number within the range

(6)- Get maximum non-prime number within the range

(7)- Get total number of non-prime numbers within the range

(8)- Enter new range

(E)- Exit program

a. The program should be in a continuous state of running unless you choose (E) then your program should exit.

b. Every choice should be programmed as a separate function

c. Your program should handle the inputs start and end of range as following:

- If range start number is 1 and end range number is 5 the range will be : 1,2,3,4,5

- If range start number is 5 and end range number is 1 the range will be : 1,2,3,4,5
